1. As a Manager: How would you handle the situation when a key team member faces a personal issue that affects 
the project timeline? What steps would you take to ensure the team stays on track, and how would you communicate 
with both the client and your team?
ANSWER: As a manager, the first step I will do is to quickly assess how critical the developer's tasks are and how
	their absence will affect the project. It is essential to provide flexibility, such as time off or adjusting 
	work hours. If necessary, I should also redistribute tasks to other team members or reassign work to the R&D
	department. Transparent communication with the R&D department is necessary, keeping them updated on the new 
	timeline without oversharing personal details. Lastly, to ensure that the workloads are manageable and the
	project stays on track, I will communicate with my team on a frequent basis.


2. As a Developer: If you were the one facing a family emergency, how would you handle the situation to ensure that 
it doesn't negatively impact the project timeline? What actions would you take to manage your workload, communicate 
effectively with your manager, and ensure the project stays on course?
ANSWER: As a developer, early communication is key. Better planning may be done if the manager is informed of the 
	problem as soon as possible. I should prioritize critical tasks and hand off remaining work with clear 
	instructions. If available, I should stay reachable for urgent matters but set clear boundaries. I will regularly
	update my availability to help manage expectations and minimize interruptions.


3. What Could Have Been Done Better?: Reflect on how both the manager and the developer could have better anticipated 
potential risks and mitigated issues before they arose. What strategies might have helped avoid this situation or 
managed it more effectively?
ANSWER: By making backup plans, both the manager and developer could have anticipated this situation. The manager could 
	ensure team members are cross-trained and that project timelines allow for unanticipated delays. Developers should
	communicate potential risks early and be clear about their availability during emergencies. Both parties would be 
	better able to handle such situation more effectively with a more formal risk management plan.
