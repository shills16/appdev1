1. AI (Artificial Intelligence)
    Purpose: AI technologies are designed to cater students's individuak requirements.
            It offers a personalized experience by considering their learning style,
            areas of strength, and interests. The platforms are ebale to instantly
            modify the content, pace, and difficulty in order to precicely meet the 
            needs of every student. 

            The primary goal of AI is to simulate human-like intelligence in machines,
            enabling them to perfomr difficult tasks and make decisions on their own.

    Usage: In information technology (IT) and education,AI has become a game-changing tool. 
            In educational settings, AI customizes learning through adaptive kearning platforms
            that evaluate the student performance and adjust materials accordingly. This 
            individualized approach enhances student engagement and improves outcomes

            AI improves cybersecurity, automates repetitive tasks, and optimizes data 
            management to streamline operations in the IT sector. Large-scales of data
            are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to find patterns, which enables 
            businesses to make informed decisions swiftly. Thus, AI serves as a critical
            driver of innovation in both industries.
    
    Examples: Social Media: Keeping you scrolling
            Digital Assistance: Hey Siri!
            Maps and Navigation
            Banking: Keeping your money safe
            Facial Recognation
            Writing
            Self-Driving Cars


2. CLOUD COMPUTING
    Purpose: The goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable access to computing
        resources and IT services.
    
    Usage: Because it offers scalable resources, improves collaboration, and makes
        information easier to access, cloud computing has completely changed both 
        IT and education. Platforms such as Google Calssroom and Microsoft Teams 
        facilitates real-time comminication between teachers and students in educational 
        settings. Similarly, in IT industry, cloud services allow for efficient data 
        storage, processing power, and software deployment, enabling organizations to
        innovate while minimizing infrastructure costs.

    Examples:  Streaming Services
            File Sharing Services
            Messaging Services
            Ride Sharing Services
            Social Media

3. BLOCKCHAIN
    Purpose: Blockchain is a way to store and secure digital data. Blockchain is
        an open ledger that multiple users can access at once. One primary benefits of that 
        the recorder information is difficult to alter without an agreement form all parties 
        involved.

    Usage: Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force int both education
        and IT industry. It improves academic record integrity in education and makes
        credential verification safe. Meanwhile, in It industry, facilitates decentralized 
        applications and smart contracts possible, promoting transparency and security.

    Examples: Cross-Border Payments
            Asset Management
            Electronic Medical Records
            Online Identity Verification
            Birth and Death Certificates
            Cryptocurrency

4. 5G
    Purpose: With the potential to revolutionize our lives in many ways, 5G is expected to 
        bring about faster download speeds, reduced latency, and increased capacity
        and connectivity for billions of devices, particularly in the fields of artificial 
        intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and the IoT.

    Usage: 5G technology significantly enhances both education and IT sectors by providing 
        high-speed connectivity and low latency. Through smooth video conferencing and interactive
        applications, it supports remote learning in educational settings and promotes collaborative 
        environments. IT sectors also use 5G to boost operational efficiency and innovation through better
        cloud sevices, IoT device management, and real-time data processing.

    Examples: Entertainement
            Autonomous Vehicles
            Smart Factories
            Smart Cities
            Smart Healthcare

5. CYBER SECURITY
    Purpose: Ensuring secure storage, managing access, and preventing unauthorized data processing,
        transfer, or deletion are the objectives of cyber security. Information availability,
        confidentiality, and integrity are all protected.

    Usage: Because it protects private information and upholds system integrity, cyber security is essential 
        to both information technology and education. Robust cyber security protocols protect intellectual
        property and student records from intrusions in educational institutions. Cyber security 
        protocols serve a similar purpose in It industry by guaranteeing secure information transmission, 
        thwart cyber threats, and enhancing overall organizational resilience against evolving digital risks.

    Examples: Firewalls
            Anti-virus Systems
            Data Encryption
